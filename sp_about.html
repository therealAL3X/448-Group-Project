                            We all have trouble in certain classes, either it's a difficult
                            subject, or we are just having a hard time grasping the material
                            itself. But we all have a common goal, pass our class by showing
                            understanding of the material. Doing this requires a lot of studying,
                            and research shows that studying increases test scores and we all know
                            this. Research also shows that distractions while studying
                            significantly causes a decrease in test scores. What is the best way
                            to minimize distractions and increase your test scores?
                            <br />
                            <br />We found that it is through Study Groups, that is why we decided
                            to build "Retrievers Together" which is a study group application
                            which pairs you with other students willing and motivated to raise
                            their test scores by studying in an efficient manner. Our system
                            allows you to take a short quiz that asks your studying preferences
                            and habits, then pairs you with other students in the same class who
                            have similar study habits. Our system offers study habit trackers,
                            study tips, and also reviews for other students that allow you to give
                            feedback to the student as well as use to ensure that students aren't
                            just freeloading off of your study time. All this is paired into an
                            intuitive design which makes it easier than ever to find a study group
                            on campus and pass that test!learning needs.
